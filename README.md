# Voice Assistant (AI Agent Model) ðŸ—£

## ðŸŒŸ Project Description
A core command-line Virtual Assistant developed in *Python 3.x*. It uses the speech_recognition and pyttsx3 libraries for voice I/O. This project serves as a functional prototype, demonstrating the fundamental logic required for building an *AI Agent/Chatbot* (a highly preferred skill mentioned in the job description).

## ðŸ’» Key Technologies
- *Python 3.x*
- pyttsx3 (Text-to-Speech)
- speech_recognition (Voice Input)

## ðŸš€ Scalability & Backend Readiness (CRUCIAL)
The underlying architecture is modular and designed for *seamless integration* into a full-stack environment. The core functionality is ready to be implemented on a *Flask* or *Django* backend for deployment as a web service. Future state planning includes storing user data and interaction logs in *MySQL/PostgreSQL* using efficient *SQL* commands.
